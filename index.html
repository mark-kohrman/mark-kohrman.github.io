              <p>
                Chicago based web developer who loves to solve problems and build things; especially with software! I've
                always had an interest in tech, but was inspired to take coding seriously as a career through my love of
                reading. A book about the
                <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">Effective Altruism</a>
                community suggested that software engineering is a career through which I can make a positive difference
                in the world, which is what I'm all about. In my free time, I enjoy distance running/biking, playing
                sports (real and fantasy), listening to nerdy podcasts about tech and economics, and volunteering at my
                local dog shelter.

              <p>
                My career in tech started as a Full Stack PHP Developer at Dealer eProcess and I have never been more
                passionate about what I do. We build car websites for auto dealers and we do it well. I also enjoy
                working on personal projects. Growing up, I wanted to be a linebacker in the NFL. After weighing in at
                under 100 pounds my freshman year of high school, I started to think I have the body frame of a fantasy
                football player. My love of football led me build a fantasy football app called "Fanalyze" for my
                capstone project at Actualize Coding Bootcamp. My app allows the fantasy football player to create teams
                and analyze whether they want to start or sit players based on weather projections the app provides. I
                used Ruby on Rails for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend and two different APIs for live sports and
                weather data. My latest deployment is a movie app that allows the user to search and rate their favorite
                movies. I'm currently working on a meditation app that allows the user to find places to meet with other
                users in the app and will have a video conferencing element (Rails for the backend and React for the
                frontend). Scroll down to my

                I love to write code and discovered this through my love of reading books. William MacAskill's
                <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/" target="_blank">"Doing Good Better"</a>
                introduced me to Effective Altruism and how evidence and reason can be used to make the world a better
                place. Biographies of historical figures have also piqued my literary interest from

                <p>
                  Built a movie app that allows the user to search their favorite movies and give them a thumbs up or
                  thumbs down. Ruby on Rails was used for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and a third party API
                  called "omdb." It was deployed on Heroku.

                  I built an app called "(app)ropriate jokes" that's live on Heroku. I used Ruby on Rails for the
                  backend with a "Dad Jokes" API and Vue.js to make the funny app name and jokes look good.
